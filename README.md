- **Project objective_1:**

  In this Excel-based project, I analyzed and visualized customer data for the years 2019, 2020, 2021. The dataset comprises net sales figures for various customer stores that sold the products.
  
**1. Customer Analysis:**
Detailed net sales breakdown by each customer store to understand product performance.

**Insights:**

**Amazon Growth:** Amazon experienced substantial growth in net sales from 2019 to 2020 (12.2M to 27.5M) and even more significant growth from 2020 to 2021 (27.5M to 82M). The 219% increase from 2020 to 2021 highlights the acceleration in sales for Amazon during this period.

**Integrated Stores:** Although the net sales for integrated stores in 2021 increased dramatically by 887%, the actual revenue is relatively low (1.4M in 2021 compared to 0.2M in 2020). This suggests a substantial percentage increase but a limited impact on overall revenue.


**Solution:**

**Optimize Integrated Stores:** Despite a substantial percentage increase, actual revenue is low. Improve product offerings, marketing, and inventory management to enhance both percentage growth and overall revenue sustainability.

**Replicate Amazon's Strategy:** Identify key factors driving Amazon's exceptional growth. Apply successful strategies, understanding product mix, marketing tactics, and potential partnerships to replicate similar success across different sales channels.

**2. Market Performance vs Target:**
Analysis of market (country) performance against targets for 2019, 2020, 2021, and a comparative analysis for 2021-target.

**Insights:**
**Negative Target Discrepancy:** In 2021, all countries show negative values in the target column, meaning actual sales are below the goal. This points to a general failure to meet sales targets worldwide.
